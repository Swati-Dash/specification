area-of-outstanding-natural-beauty,area-of-outstanding-natural-beauty,Protected areas of countryside with a distinctive character and natural beauty,,,,,,Area of outstanding natural beauty,Areas of outstanding natural beauty,,,"An Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is a protected area in the countryside with a distinctive character and natural beauty designated by [Natural England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england) under the [Section 82 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/37/section/82).


A local authority must make sure that any development proposals have regard for the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the AONB. The NPPF sets out in [paragraph 172 ](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/15-conserving-and-enhancing-the-natural-environment)that “great weight should be given to conserving and enhancing landscape and scenic beauty in National Parks, the Broads and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which have the highest status of protection” Local Authorities can consult Natural England for advice to help make a decision on a planning application that may have an impact on an AONB. Natural England can object to a planning application if mitigation measures aren’t acceptable. A local authority may need to request that appropriate compensation measures are included (such as habitat creation on another site) if it isn’t possible to minimise the risks to the protected site. There is specific [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications) on how to review planning applications in protected sites and areas.

A local authority must ensure any development proposals take into account the conservation and enhancement of the natural beauty of the AONB. [The National Policy Planning Framework (NPPF)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2) sets out in [paragraph 172 ](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/15-conserving-and-enhancing-the-natural-environment)that “great weight should be given to conserving and enhancing landscape and scenic beauty in National Parks, the Broads and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which have the highest status of protection.” Natural England can offer local authorities advice on a planning application decision which may have an impact on an AONB. Natural England can object to a planning application if mitigation measures aren’t acceptable. If it isn’t possible to minimise the risks to the protected site, local authorities can request an appropriate compensation measure such as habitat creation on another site. There is specific [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications) on how to review planning applications in protected sites and areas.
