Natural England can object to a planning application if mitigation measures aren’t acceptable. A local authority may need to request that appropriate compensation measures are included (such as habitat creation on another site) if it isn’t possible to minimise the risks to the protected site. There is specific [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications) on how to review planning applications in protected sites and areas.

Brownfield land is currently, or was previously, built on and therefore has good potential for housing-led development.

### Impact on planning decisions

Building on brownfield land helps protect the countryside by reducing the pressure to build on greenfield sites or land that has never been built on. It also has the potential advantage of being able to use infrastructure from previous development. The planning process on some brownfield sites can be fast tracked.

### Responsible organisations and guidance

Local planning authorities designate brownfield land. They also keep up-to-date registers of brownfield land appropriate for residential development.",development,geography,Q896586,Brownfield_land
