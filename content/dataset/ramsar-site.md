A Ramsar site is an internationally protected site listed as a Wetland of International Importance.

### Impact on planning decisions

Any development in a RAMSAR site will need special consideration and may require consultation with specific organisations. 

### Responsible organisations and guidance

They are designated by [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/) and managed by [Natural England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england). If a ramsar site could be affected by development, Natural England should be consulted. There is specific [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications) on how to review planning applications in protected sites and areas.
