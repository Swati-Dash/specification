Historic parks and gardens are those listed in the [Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/registered-parks-and-gardens/). They intend to protect significant land that has been designed rather than natural land.Â 

The register is kept by [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) with assistance from the [Gardens Trust](https://thegardenstrust.org/).

Registration is a 'material consideration' in the planning process, meaning that planning authorities must consider the impact of any proposed development on the landscapes' special character. The [NPPF](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2) sets out that registered parks and gardens are designated heritage assets of the highest significance.

Local planning authorities must consult Historic England where a planning application affects a Grade I or II* registered park or garden or battlefield. They will also consult the Gardens Trust on all applications affecting registered parks or gardens, regardless of the grade of the site.
