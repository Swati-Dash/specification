Local planning authorities can serve a Building Preservation Notice (BPN) on a building owner if they consider a building
is in danger of demolition or alteration in a way that might affect its special character.
BPN's take effect immediately, protecting the building for a limited time period, as if it were listed.

The local planning authority must make an application to [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/)
to list the building at the same time that the BPN is served.

We expect to develop a data specification to help LPAs to publish their building preservation notices to supplement this data from Historic England.
