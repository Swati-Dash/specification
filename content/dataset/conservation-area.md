These are designated areas of historic and architectural interest in which there are legal restrictions on what changes can be made to buildings, greenery and street furniture in order to preserve the unique character of the place.Â 

They safeguard original architectural features and picturesque surroundings, but permitted development rights are more limited and you will need planning permission for works that are restricted.

Local planning authorities who also have a duty to review past designations from time to time to determine if any further parts of their area should be conservation areas. Historic England gives [more information](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/your-home/owning-historic-property/conservation-area/) on how this works.
