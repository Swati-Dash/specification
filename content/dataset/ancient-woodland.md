Areas that have been wooded continuously since at least 1600 AD They are relatively undisturbed by human development and are therefore unique habitats.

Permission for development that will cause the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats is only granted in exceptional circumstances unless there are exceptional reasons and thereâ€™s an additional compensation strategy.

Natural England and Forestry Commission [Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ancient-woodland-and-veteran-trees-protection-surveys-licences) is used in planning decisions.
