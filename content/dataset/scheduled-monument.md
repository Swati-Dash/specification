An historic building or site such as Roman remains, burial mounds, castles, bridges, earthworks, the remains of deserted villages and industrial sites. Churches or a building in residential use can't be designated as scheduled monuments.

### Impact on planning decisions

You will need consent from the Secretary of State before any work is carried out on a scheduled monument. [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) manages the process.

### Responsible organisations and guidance

The Secretary of State for [Digital, Culture, Media and Sport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport).
