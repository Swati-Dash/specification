Special areas of conservation (SACs) are areas of land which are internationally designated to protect specific habitats and species.

### Impact on planning decisions

There are restrictions on activities and developments that might affect a designated or protected area, for example building new houses or roads.Â 

### Responsible organisations and guidance

Special areas of conservation are designated by [DEFRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs) with advice from the [Joint Nature Conservation Committee](https://jncc.gov.uk/).

There is specific [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications) on how to review planning applications in protected sites and areas.
