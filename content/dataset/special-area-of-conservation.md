Special areas of conservation (SACs) are area of land which have been designated by
[DEFRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs),
with advice from the [Joint Nature Conservation Committee](https://jncc.gov.uk/),
to protect specific habitats and species.

There is [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications) on how to review planning applications in protected sites and areas.
