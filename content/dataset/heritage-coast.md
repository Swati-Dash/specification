A heritage coast is established to conserve the best stretches of undeveloped coast in England. 

### Impact on planning decisions

Heritage coasts are protected in the planning system. Major development within a heritage coast is unlikely to be appropriate, unless it is compatible with its special character. 

### Responsible organisations and guidance

A heritage coast is defined by agreement between the relevant maritime local authorities and [Natural England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england).
