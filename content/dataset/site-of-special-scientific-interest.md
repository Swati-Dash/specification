Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) are nationally protected sites that have features such as wildlife or geology.Â 

You will not normally be permitted to carry out works that could have an adverse effect on a SSSI. There are certain things you cannot do on SSSI land without consulting Natural England and getting consent from them first.

SSSIs are created by [Natural England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england) and there is specific [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest) on managing them.
