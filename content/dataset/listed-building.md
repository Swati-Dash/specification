Listed building status protects buildings that are of special architectural and historic interest. 

There are 3 grades of listing:

-   grade I buildings are of exceptional interest

-   grade II* buildings are particularly important buildings of more than special interest

-   grade II buildings are of special interest

### Why are they important for planning?

You need special consent before making changes to a listed building that affect its character. 

Historic England also need to be notified or consulted when the setting of a Grade I or Grade II* listed building may be affected.

### Responsible organisations and guidance

[Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/)  designates the status but anyone can nominate a building to be listed.
