An area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) is a protected area of landscape whose distinctive character and natural beauty are precious enough to be safeguarded in the national interest. Each AONB must have a management plan which is reviewed every 5 years.

Local Authorities can consult Natural England for advice to help make a decision on a planning application that may have an impact on an AONB. Natural England can object to a planning application if mitigation measures aren’t acceptable. A local authority may need to request that appropriate compensation measures are included (such as habitat creation on another site) if it isn’t possible to minimise the risks to the protected site. 

[Natural England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england), which advises the government on England’s landscapes, designates AONBs and there is specific [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications) to help local authorities decide on planning applications in protected sites and areas.
