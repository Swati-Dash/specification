An area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) is a protected area of landscape whose distinctive character and natural beauty are precious enough to be safeguarded in the national interest. Each AONB must have a management plan which is reviewed every 5 years. Local Authorities can consult Natural England for advice to help make a decision on a planning application that may have an impact on an AONB.

### Impact on planning decisions

You will need to consult with Natural England on any proposed development in an AONB. You may need to incorporate appropriate compensation measures into any planning application. 

### Responsible organisations and guidance

[Natural England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england), which advises the government on Englandâ€™s landscapes, designates AONBs and there is specific [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications) to help local authorities decide on planning applications in protected sites and areas.
