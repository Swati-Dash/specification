A Tree Preservation Order (TPO) can be placed on single trees, groups of trees and even whole woodlands.

### Impact on planning decisions

Anyone wanting to cut down, top, lop or uproot trees subject to an order must first apply to the local planning authority for consent unless an [exception applies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-preservation-orders-and-trees-in-conservation-areas#limitations). Unauthorised work to a protected tree is a criminal offence.

### Responsible organisations and guidance

Tree Preservation Orders are made by local planning authorities following the [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-preservation-orders-and-trees-in-conservation-areas).
