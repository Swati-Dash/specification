Some types of development do not need planning permission. This is called [permitted development rights](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/permitted-development-rights-for-householders-technical-guidance). An article 4 direction means permitted development rights are withdrawn from a building or area.

### Impact on planning decisions

Where thereâ€™s an article 4 direction, a planning application may be needed for work that would otherwise have been allowed under permitted development.

### Responsible organisations and guidance

Local planning authorities or the [Secretary of State](https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/secretary-of-state-for-housing-communities-and-local-government). Guidance sets out [when planning permission is needed](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/when-is-permission-required).
